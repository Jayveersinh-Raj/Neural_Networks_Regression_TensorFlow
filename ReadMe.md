In this notebook, neural networks with not so big dataset (50 elements) with single numbers to predict single numbers by recognising patterns/function is covered.
1. In the end learned to save and load pre-trained models and they can resume learning where it was left
2. Build different deep neural nets
3. Learned to tune hyperparameters to fit the model
4. Concept of 3 sets in ML
5. Importance of visualising and experimenting
